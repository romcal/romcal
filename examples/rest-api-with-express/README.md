# Using romcal as a REST API with Express.js

From this project dir (`rest-api-with-express`):

```shell
cd examples/rest-api-with-express

npm install
npm start
```

And open the URL provided by the terminal.\

Note: some browsers like Firefox has a built-in JSON viewer.
Another great tool to test REST APIs is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
