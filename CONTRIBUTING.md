## Contributing

Like any other open-source projects, there are multiple ways to contribute to this project:

- as a developer, depending on your skills and experience,
- as a user who enjoys romcal and wants to help.

##### Reporting Bugs

If you found something broken or not working properly, feel free to create an issue in GitHub with as much information as possible, such as logs and how to reproduce the problem. Before opening the issue, make sure that:

- You have read this documentation.
- You are using the latest version of romcal.
- You already searched other issues to see if your problem or request was already reported.

##### Improving the Documentation

Currently, the documentation resides in the [`README.md`](README.md) file, but we plan to move it the GitHub Wiki ([#57](https://github.com/romcal/romcal/issues/57)). Therefore currently, you can improve this documentation by forking the `romcal/romcal` repository, updating the content of [`README.md`](README.md) and creating a pull request.

If you are new to the Git workflow, do check out our simple [Contributor’s Guide](https://github.com/romcal/romcal/wiki/Contributor’s-guide).

#### We ❤️ Pull Requests

A pull request does not need to be a fix for a bug or implementing something new. Software can always be improved, legacy code removed and tests are always welcome!

Please do not be afraid of contributing code, make sure it follows these rules:

- Your code compiles, does not break any of the existing code in the `master` branch and does not cause conflicts.
- The code must pass all the Travis CI tests.
- The code is readable and has comments, that aren’t superfluous or unnecessary.
- An overview or context is provided as the description (initial message) of the pull request. It does not need to be too extensive.

Extra points if your code comes with tests!

#### Bootstrapping code!

We leverage `nvm` to standardize our node version usage. You can use the same version we use for tests & development with 2 simple commands:
```shell
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
```

assuming you have nvm installed, obviously.

Learn more: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
Automatic nvm switching: [deeper shell integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration)

After that, you just have to install dependencies:
```shell
$ npm ci
```

And you're bootstrapped. Thanks for contributing!
